# Visionary-Linear-Algebra

We will first establish a grounding in the requisite areas of Linear Algebra; and learn to use the NumPy library. We will then apply these to basic Machine Vision problems, such as distinguishing hand-written digits in the MNIST data set. Finally, we will apply those techniques to a Machine Vision solution to differentiate real-world objects, such as dogs and cats.

Deliverables: 
* Homework assignments oriented around linear algebra operations (e.g. vector projection, matrix decomposition, eigenvectors, subspaces, ...)
* 2-class Machine Vision problem (e.g. differentiating images of dogs vs cats), to be coded in Python
* Stretch goal: a more complex Machine Vision challenge, with more object classes, or other complexity
